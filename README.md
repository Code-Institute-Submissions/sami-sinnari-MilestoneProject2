## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

> - Highlight the main values of our team to convince the customers to buy from us.
> - Showcase some of our previous PC designs, in order to attract the customer.
> - Obtaining subscriptions for mailing list, thereby increasing customer databases.
> - Directions to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter in order to interact more with customers.

### User Goals 

> - _"I don't have a PC or Laptop at home and so I mostly do my reaserch on a mobile phone"_
> - _"I want to see some of their previous PC designs before ordering"_
> - _"I want to get in touch with the company because i'd like to add some feature in a PC"_
> - _"I want to be able to subscribe to PCbuilds so I can get update on their future computers."_
> - _"I want to be able to join a facebook/instagram or twitter page so I can get to know the company"_
> - _"I would like to buy from them, but I'd love too see what else they offer"_


### Site Owner Goals :

> - Create a responsive website as some customers do not use different devices.
> - Create a gallery section where customers can navigate through pictures.
> - Create a "Contact Us" section, to assure customers we can always upgrade PC based on their needs.
> - Create a "Subscribe" card in order to keep subscribers up-to-date with our latest releases.
> - Create a Social links buttons at the end of the page so they can follow us.
> - Create a vast "Order here" page, with various PC builds and cart.

### Design
> - The main focus of the design is to allow the customers to aquire the information they need in order to purchase a product from our company. Short paragraphs of content were added just to provide enough details, and highligted are four cards which display the main core values of the company. Top quality images are showcased in order to attract the customer. Nevertheless, points of contact are provided via "Contact Us" page and Social media links in "Subscribe" card.


#### Colors

 For this project I decided to use only three colors, as the main focus was simplicity. 

![Color Scheme Generated by coolors.co](assets/images/palette.png)

#### Typography

 > - I have used two fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) on the website. 
 > 1. Rokkitt (fall-back font Serif) - The Standard attractive look of the font was used in headings and Order Page layout, as in my opinion it fits perfectly to achive a professional lok.
 > 2. Architects Daughter (fall-back font Serif) - Not so standard look was chosen as it gives a nice balanced diversity on the website.

### Wireframes

#### Mobile view

## Features

### Existing Features : 

> - Navigation : Navigation bar made with JS is designed in a way that it will follow the user where he/she goes. Hamburger menu will slide from right to left with navigation links included. It consists of six links : **Home**, **About Us**, **Gallery**, **Order Now**, **Contact** and **Subscribe**.
> - One-page website with 6 sections and one seperate page for order section.
> - Order page which containes products. Products can be added to the cart and their number can be increased or decreased. The price of the product will change as customer is changing the amount. If customer goes to Home page, products will be saved in the cart as they are stored. JSON used in that section.
> -  Footer which containes **Subscribe** card and **Social links**

### Features Left to Implement when relevant knowledge gained :
