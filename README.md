## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

> - Showcase some of our previous PC designs, in order to attract the customer.
> - Obtaining subscriptions for mailing list, thereby increasing customer databases.
> - Directions to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter in order to get more customers.

### User Goals

### Site Owner Goals :

> - Create a responsive website as some customers do not use different devices.
> - Create a gallery section where customers can navigate through pictures.
> - Create a "Contact Us" section, to assure customers we can always upgrade PC based on their needs.

> - Create a vast "Order here" page, with various PC builds and cart.

### Design
> - The main focus of the design is to allow the customers to aquire the information they need in order to purchase a product from our company. Short paragraphs of content were added just to provide enough details, and highligted are four cards which display the main core values of the company. Top quality images are showcased in order to attract the customer. Nevertheless, points of contact are provided via "Contact Us" page and Social media links in "Subscribe" card.


#### Colors

 For this project I decided to use only three colors, as the main focus was simplicity.

## Features

### Existing Features : 

> - Navigation : Navigation bar made with JS is designed in a way that it will follow the user where he/she goes. Hamburger menu will slide from right to left with navigation links included. It consists of six links : **Home**, **About Us**, **Gallery**, **Order Now**, **Contact** and **Subscribe**.
> - One-page website with 6 sections and one seperate page for order section.
> - Order page which containes products. Products can be added to the cart and their number can be increased or decreased. The price of the product will change as customer is changing the amount. If customer goes to Home page, products will be saved in the cart as they are stored. JSON used in that section.

> - I would like to connect the **Send** button in Contact Us page and **Subscribe** button in the footer with back-end technologies.
> - I would like to connect the **Purchase** button in Order Now page with [Stripes](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/creating-a-payments-page) **Crate a payment page**.
